# terminal-boredom

An application for those boring nights in front of the shell.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Spending long days or nights in front of a terminal with nothing to do? Tired of running commands and mindlessly staring at your shell for them to complete? With terminal-boredom, this problem is no more. Simply download terminal-boredom, run it before your command, and have a variety of entertainment while you wait for those long commands!

terminal-boredom is an interactive CLI Python application where you may demo and play with a variety of utilities and short applications. Do not worry about missing when the command finishes completion either, as terminal-boredom will monitor the process and notify you via a distinctive colorful header when it finishes.

terminal-boredom stands as an application I have made for myself and my father, and I hope it wil serve you well too. It's a unique proof of concept that demonstrates that you don't need anything fancy to have fun with a computer.

Interested in adding your own applications? terminal-boredom follows a very modular design. Take a look at the Game.py template class and all that inherit it for inspiration. You are only three functions away from drawing to a screen!
